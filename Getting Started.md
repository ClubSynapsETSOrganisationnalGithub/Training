Then check:
- System root C:\
- Make sure Python27 has been deleted

For GCC, follow instructions at [Website](https://techsupportwhale.com/install-gcc-compiler-on-windows/#:~:text=A%20Beginner%E2%80%99s%20Guide%20to%20Install%20gcc%20and%20g%2B%2B,Test%20installation%20of%20gcc%20and%20g%2B%2B%20compiler.%20) but **do not use their download link, use the link provided before and chose the Sourceforge link!!!**. Modern microcontrollers are built on 32 bits systems, make to install 32 bits version not just 64bits.
